TODO:

+ SAFETY: change SQL inserts to protect against SQL injections

+ BUG: correct for error when player has not enough questions left (wants to play 10 rounds, but already answered all but 8 questions)

+ FEATURE: save (high-)scores from players, show own statistics (questions answered per category)

+ FEATURE: option to play with all questions or those you havent answered yet.

+ NICE: improve optics of CLI

+ BIG FEATURE: GUI adding
